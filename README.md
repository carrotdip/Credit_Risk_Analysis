# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. We first oversampled with Random Oversampling and SMOTE, then undersampled with the Cluster Centroid approach, and finally, used a combinatory analysis with over- and under-sampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm. We then utilized two machine learning models, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier, to reduce bias within the models. We will then compare the performance of these machine learning models to determine the best approach to predict credit risk.
## Results
**Random Oversampling**
**SMOTE**
Synthetic Minority OverSampling Technique
**Cluster Centroids**
**SMOTEENN**
**Balanced Random Forest Classifier**
